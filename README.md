# Abstract

**Forest is an AI-focused innovation market** leveraging positive learnings from **Bitcoin mining** and **preventing tokenomics pitfalls** that allow oligarchies of large token holders to control networks to their benefit **like in Bittensor**.

In Forest, **all services are available for purchase** by real-world clients on day one. This allows us to **move away from corruption-prone stake-weighted voting** and instead **distribute tokens based on verified blockchain data** on who attracts the most new customers to the network.

Furthermore we ensure fair competition by utilizing **cheat-proof decentralized AI benchmarking** in the reward function and **collateral** **slashing** for attempted cheating. 

To ensure **long-term economic viability** the network treasury **earns a commission** on revenue generated by participants.
