Forest AI a **network of incentivised Protocols**, each solving a **specific AI challenge** with **Providers selling solutions to Customers** and **Validators ensuring quality** by utilizing a **novel fair validation framework.** 

# Abstract

**Forest is an AI-focused innovation market** leveraging positive learnings from **Bitcoin mining** and **preventing tokenomics pitfalls** that allow oligarchies of large token holders to control networks to their benefit **like in Bittensor**.

In Forest, **all services are available for purchase** by real-world clients on day one. This allows us to **move away from corruption-prone stake-weighted voting** and instead **distribute tokens based on verified blockchain data** on who attracts the most new customers to the network.

Furthermore we ensure fair competition by utilizing **cheat-proof decentralized AI benchmarking** in the reward function and **collateral** **slashing** for attempted cheating. 

To ensure **long-term economic viability** the network treasury **earns a commission** on revenue generated by participants.

# Vocab Cheatsheet

**Protocols**: Standardize the competition for an AI task. Define unified API for Providers and quality evaluation criteria for Validators. Protocols are created and managed by Protocol Owners.

**Protocol Owners** (aka PTO): Define protocol goals, rules, parameters and hyperparameters.

**Users** (aka Customers): Purchase AI services from Providers, influencing token rewards with their economic choices.

**Providers**: Offer best AI services to Users and compete for Rewards. 

**Validators**: Evaluate Providers' performance, ensure cross-compatibility, aggregate the results and rank all Providers in a specific Protocol to find the best innovators.

**Emissions / Rewards**: Tokens emitted to Actors for positive behaviours that progress the goals of the ForestAI Network. ForestAI rewards:

- Protocols for solving valuable challenges  
- Providers for having high performance  
- Validators for truthful and consistent completion of Provider validations

# ForestAI Value Proposition

**For Protocol Owners**: PTOs get a share of reward emissions (in FOREST) and a revenue share (in USDC/FOREST) for facilited user-provider transactions within their Protocols. 

**For Providers**: Providers benefit from a new powerful distribution channel for their Services, prove their performance to the whole world and get rewards for innovating on valuable challenges if their performance is high enough. 

**For Validators**: For checking the performance and quality of provider services, Validators get rewarded in FOREST.

**For Users**: 10x better AI Cloud experience and cost reduction: access to a wide & comparable offering from competing Providers, better prices, full transparency on Provider's past performance, unified interfaces and customer protection programme which mitigates the risk for trying out unknown Providers.
