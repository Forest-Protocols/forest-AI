# Abstract

Forest is an AI-focused innovation engine leveraging positive learnings from Bitcoin mining and preventing tokenomics pitfalls that allow an oligarchy of large token holders to control the network to their benefit like in bitTensor.
In Forest, all services are available for purchase by real-world clients on day one. This allows us to move away from corruption-prone stake-weighted voting and instead distribute tokens based on who attracts the most new customers to the network.
Furthermore we ensure fair competition by utilizing cheat-proof decentralized AI benchmarking in the reward function and collateral slashing for attempted cheating. 
To ensure long-term economic viability the network treasury earns a commission on revenue generated by participants. 


## Specifications

The specification is maintained as a Markdown file. There are three important sections:

1. [Overview](/docs/OVERVIEW.md) - A high level overview of the protocol.
2. [Contracts](/contracts) - Solidity smart contracts defining token distribution mechanism.
3. [Discussions](https://github.com/Forest-Protocols/protocols/discussions) - A forum where new proposals to change the specification are discussed.
