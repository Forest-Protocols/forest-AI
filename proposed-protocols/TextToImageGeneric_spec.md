# Text to Image Generation (Text to Image)

## Goal

Given a textual description, the model should generate a high-quality image that accurately represents the provided text. The goal is to maximize visual fidelity, creativity, and relevance to the text prompt.

Additional automated scoring criteria:
- Image resolution and clarity
- Adherence to the specified dimensions and file size
- Originality and absence of artifacts

## Example

~~~~~~~
A serene lake surrounded by lush green pine forests under a vibrant orange and pink sunset sky.
In the foreground, there is a wooden pier extending into the lake, with a small lantern glowing warmly.
On the lake, a rowboat with two people wearing hats is gently drifting, while a family of ducks swims nearby.
In the background, snow-capped mountains are visible, partially shrouded in mist.
The scene is reflected on the still water, creating a mirror-like effect.
Artistic style: hyper-realistic, with intricate textures on the wood, water ripples, and detailed lighting effects.
